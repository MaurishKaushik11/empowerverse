# Recommendation Algorithm Documentation

## Overview

The Video Recommendation Engine uses a sophisticated hybrid approach combining multiple machine learning techniques to provide personalized video recommendations. This document explains how the recommendation system works.

## Algorithm Components

### 1. Deep Neural Network Recommendation

**Architecture:**
- Multi-layer perceptron with attention mechanism
- User embedding layer (128 dimensions)
- Item embedding layer (128 dimensions)
- Hidden layers: [256, 128, 64]
- Attention mechanism with 8 heads
- Output: Probability score (0-1)

**Features:**
- User profile features (preferences, interaction history)
- Item content features (category, topic, engagement metrics)
- Temporal features (recency, trending score)

**Training:**
- Loss function: Binary cross-entropy
- Optimizer: Adam with learning rate 0.001
- Regularization: Dropout (0.3), Batch normalization
- Training data: User-item interaction pairs

### 2. Collaborative Filtering

**User-Based Collaborative Filtering:**
- Calculates user-user similarity using cosine similarity
- Finds top-K similar users (K=50)
- Predicts ratings based on similar users' preferences
- Handles sparse data using matrix factorization

**Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:**
- Calculates item-item similarity using cosine similarity
- Recommends items similar to user's previously interacted items
- More stable than user-based for sparse data

**Matrix Factorization (SVD):**
- Decomposes user-item matrix into user and item factors
- Reduces dimensionality to 50 components
- Handles missing values and sparse data effectively
- Provides latent factor representations

### 3. Content-Based Filtering

**Content Features:**
- Category information (one-hot encoded)
- Topic information (one-hot encoded)
- Engagement metrics (views, likes, shares, ratings)
- Temporal features (creation date, trending score)
- Text features (title length, tag count)

**Similarity Calculation:**
- Feature vector normalization
- Cosine similarity between user preferences and item features
- Weighted combination of different feature types

### 4. Graph Neural Networks (Optional)

**Graph Construction:**
- User-item interaction graph
- Item-item similarity graph
- User-user similarity graph

**GNN Architecture:**
- Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)
- 3 layers with hidden dimensions [64, 64, 32]
- Global mean pooling for graph-level representations
- Dropout for regularization

## Hybrid Scoring

The final recommendation score combines multiple approaches:

```
Final Score = 0.5 × Deep_Learning_Score + 
              0.3 × Collaborative_Filtering_Score + 
              0.2 × Content_Based_Score
```

**Weight Justification:**
- Deep Learning (50%): Captures complex non-linear patterns
- Collaborative Filtering (30%): Leverages user behavior patterns
- Content-Based (20%): Ensures content relevance and diversity

## Cold Start Problem

**New Users (< 5 interactions):**
1. Mood-based recommendations using content categories
2. Popular content from the last 7 days
3. Trending content based on engagement metrics
4. Gradual transition to personalized recommendations

**New Items:**
1. Content-based similarity to existing popular items
2. Category and topic-based recommendations
3. Trending boost for recently added content

## Recommendation Pipeline

### 1. User Profile Analysis
```python
def analyze_user_profile(user_id):
    - Get interaction history (last 100 interactions)
    - Calculate engagement patterns
    - Extract category/topic preferences
    - Compute user embedding vector
    - Determine personalization level
```

### 2. Candidate Generation
```python
def generate_candidates(user_profile, filters):
    - Apply category/topic filters
    - Filter by availability and lock status
    - Get recent and trending content
    - Apply diversity constraints
    - Limit to MAX_RECOMMENDATIONS × 2
```

### 3. Feature Engineering
```python
def extract_features(user, items):
    - User features: preferences, interaction patterns
    - Item features: content, engagement, temporal
    - User-item interaction features
    - Contextual features (time, device, etc.)
```

### 4. ML Scoring
```python
def calculate_scores(user_features, item_features):
    - Deep learning model prediction
    - Collaborative filtering scores
    - Content-based similarity scores
    - Graph neural network scores (if available)
```

### 5. Hybrid Ranking
```python
def hybrid_ranking(scores):
    - Weighted combination of different scores
    - Apply business rules and constraints
    - Ensure diversity in recommendations
    - Apply freshness and trending boosts
```

### 6. Post-processing
```python
def post_process(ranked_items):
    - Remove already interacted items
    - Apply diversity filters
    - Ensure category/topic distribution
    - Apply final ranking adjustments
```

## Performance Metrics

### Online Metrics
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Percentage of recommendations clicked
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of clicks leading to desired actions
- **Engagement Time**: Average time spent on recommended content
- **Diversity**: Variety in recommended content categories
- **Novelty**: Percentage of new/unseen content recommended

## Model Training and Updates

### Training Data

## Scalability Considerations

### Computational Complexity
- **User-based CF**: O(U²) for similarity computation

- **Deep Learning**: O(batch_size × model_parameters)

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Approximate Algorithms**: Use approximate nearest neighbor search
2. **Sampling**: Sample negative examples for training
3. **Caching**: Cache embeddings and similarity matrices
4. **Batch Processing**: Process recommendations in batches

### Bias Detection and Mitigation
- **Popularity Bias**: Ensure diverse content recommendation
- **Cold Start Bias**: Fair treatment of new users/items
- **Demographic Bias**: Avoid discrimination based on user attributes
- **Temporal Bias**: Balance between fresh and evergreen content

### Explainability
